I) Lasso impact on USPS
We show how l2 (ridge regression) and l1 (lasso) penalties affect the classifier.
We fix the hyperparameters to get similar scores between the 3 classifiers. 
The ridge regression shrinks the coefficients. 
The lasso on top of that put weights at 0. We get a sparse vector of weights.

II) Denoising
We show how a sparse representation affect the results.

III) Filling missing part of an image
We compare a naive filling and the filling described in [3] which put a priority value to each point of 
the missing part contour.
